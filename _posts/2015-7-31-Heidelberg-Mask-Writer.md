We use 5 inch chrome on quartz masks, usually bought at CNF when we're ready to use them, as they age over a few months. 

#GDS Requirements
Polygons in your GDS become removed chrome. 

**MAKE SURE YOUR MASK GDS IS CENTERED**

#Post Exposure
* **Etch** Use spinner beside Heidelberg, Program 2
* **Develop** Immediately after etch, run Program 1
* **Strip** Run through strip bath in Spinner Room
* **Rinse and Dry** Back at Etch/Develop spinner, Program 10
