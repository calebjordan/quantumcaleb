Oxford Instruments Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition system. Back corner near the PT740 Etcher. 

Max deposition: 2-3 um, before buildup starts to flake onto wafer.

**Notes**

* Set temperature every step

* Only modify the chemistry in the deposition step

* After use, run clean for a time equal to your total deposition time + 10 minutes. You can prepare this while venting to remove wafer.

* Send in carrier wafer, start clean, log out
