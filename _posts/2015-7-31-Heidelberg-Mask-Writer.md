We use 5 inch chrome on quartz masks, usually bought at CNF when we're ready to use them, as they age over a few months. 

#GDS Requirements
* Polygons in your GDS become removed chrome. 
* Make sure your polygons consist of less than 4000 points.
* Convert your job file offline before running mask. It takes 30 more seconds, and ensures you don't have to waste God knows how many hours of your life making another mask. 


**MAKE SURE YOUR MASK GDS IS CENTERED**

#Post Exposure
* **Etch** Use spinner beside Heidelberg, Program 2
* **Develop** Immediately after etch, run Program 1
* **Strip** Run through strip bath in Spinner Room
* **Rinse and Dry** Back at Etch/Develop spinner, Program 10
