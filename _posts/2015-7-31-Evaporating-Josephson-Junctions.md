# Develop E-Beam Resist

**Developer** 3:1 IPA:MIBK

* Immerse and agitate (shake with tweezers) in 20mL of developer for 70z
* Immediately rinse with IPA for 10s
* Dry w/ dry N2
* Check junctions with scope

# Loading sample

* Load the sample so that the big wire is facing up and away
* Open roughing pump
* Turn on turbo, start timer for 22 minutes
* At end of 22 minutes, close rougher, stop turbo
* Open gate valve
* Start timer for cryopumping, 60 minutes

# Ion Milling

* Close ballast
* Add Ar, adjusting IG2 to 2.8E-4
* Turn on ion mill with sample facing window
* Turn on discharge, beam, let settle

# Beam Alignment

* Turn on water
* Turn key, turn main on, High V on, Source on
* Put the Inficon in manual mode, press reset, start, manual
* Increase to 5% to align beam in center of Al. 



# Evaporation

* Increase to 20% for 1 minute
* Increase to 40% for 1 minute

## 1st Layer

* Rotate stage to -11&deg;
* Increase deposition rate to 2-3 //(\angstrom//)s
* Open shutter and zero meter
* While evaporating, prime ballast with //(O_2//). Max out pressure gauge, close valve.
* At .4 kAngstroms (40nm), close shutter
* Turn off E-Beam
* Close gate valve

## Oxidation

* If ballast is not primed, during deposition of 1st layer, do it now.
* Open ballast slightly to here 'puff'
* Start timer for 30 minutes
* Increase O2 until CM1 reads appropriate pressure (30.0 for now). **This controls oxidation thickness.** Close valve, open ballast fully. 
* Open Rougher
* Start Turbo
* Stop Turbo as soon as it hits full speed
* 

## 2nd Layer

* Rotate stage to 12&deg;
* Turn on E-Beam and increase to 40% again
* Open shutter and zero meter
* Evaporate .6 kA (600nm), close shutter
* Turn off E-Beam
* Close gate valve

## Vent

* Add small puff of \\(N_2\\) to slow turbo, which should still be spinning from oxidation step
* Once turbo is under 1kRPM, open \\(N_2\\) fully to vent to atmosphere.
* Remove sample
* Close lid, open rougher, start turbo
