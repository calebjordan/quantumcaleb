This tool is amazing but terrible

Wafer exposure takes between 5-15 minutes, add another 1-2 minutes for loading and unloading. All of the work here goes in to preparing the job file.

# Exposure Parameters
**Energy** 25 mJ/cm^2

**Focus offset** -0.2 \\mu m

**Illumination Mode** Conventional

**Numerical Aperture** 0.63

**Sigma - outer** 0.75


# Post Exposure Bake
135&deg;C for 90s in Spinner Room

# Develop
in ASML room, Program 6
**726MIF 90s DP**

Developer will occasionally run out, just check that wafer is coated rather than splattered. If you do run out, just develop again in the contact aligner room and let someone know that the machine is out.
