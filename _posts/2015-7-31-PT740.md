You must condition the chamber before each etch. If the left chamber was last used, condition for 10 minutes. If the right chamber was used, condition for 20 minutes. If you are confident with your ASML exposure, is a good idea to start the conditioning while the wafer to be etched is exposing. You should have just enough time to bake and develop the wafer in the 10-20 minutes of conditioning. 

Make sure to pump down the load lock before signing out of the tool. 

## Resist Strip
After etching, run through strip bath to clean off resist, then run through GLEN to make sure all resist is gone.

On the GLEN, 
RIE Mode, Process 3-0

Log in and vent while wafer is in the last bath. The price is per use, not by time.
